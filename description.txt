Project Title:
Tic Tac Toe
Description:
Implementation of the game Tic Tac Toe.
Two main classes:
1. Plane - contains two dimensional array with state of each cell,
method that takes O or X as an argument and returns list of optimal moves using min-max algorithm
(first is the best and last is the worst move).
2. User - contains whether player is O or X, there are two child classes,
one for real user and second for computer.

When starting the program, user should specify what players will play the game
(player vs player, bot vs bot or mixed).
